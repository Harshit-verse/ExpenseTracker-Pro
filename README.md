### Real talk (important)
This project is **resume-worthy** if you describe it right:

> *Built a multi-feature expense tracking web app with dashboards, budgeting, goals, and analytics using JavaScript and data visualization.*

That’s not student fluff. That’s **product thinking**.

If you want next:
- Resume bullet points for this project
- A LinkedIn post showing screenshots
- README badges + polish
- Help deploying **each tab as SPA-style**

You’ve crossed from “projects” to **portfolio assets**.
